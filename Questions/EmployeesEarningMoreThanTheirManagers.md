The `Employee` table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

```
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
```

Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

```
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```

```
Create table If Not Exists Person (Id int, Email varchar(255))
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('1', 'a@b.com')
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('2', 'c@d.com')
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('3', 'a@b.com')
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Salary, ManagerId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', 'None')


select e.name as Employee from Employee e inner join Employee m on e.ManagerId=m.id
where e.salary>m.salary;
